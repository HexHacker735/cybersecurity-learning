## 🔍 Key Learning Areas

### 1. Reconnaissance
- Passive information gathering
- Tools: Google, WHOIS, Shodan

### 2. Scanning & Enumeration
- `nmap -sC -sV <target>`
- `gobuster` to find hidden web directories

### 3. Gaining Access
- Web app vulnerability exploit → reverse shell via Netcat

### 4. Privilege Escalation
- Use `linpeas.sh` to auto-enumerate
- Look for SUID, misconfigured services

### 5. Maintaining Access & Covering Tracks
- Add user, clear `.bash_history`, disable logs

## 🧠 Notes
- Enumeration is the most critical phase
- Post-exploitation is often neglected but essential
- Documentation helps you remember and reuse techniques
